# setoolkit-website-cloning-lab
Website cloning lab using SEToolkit for ethical hacking education and testing

Tool Overview: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is an open-source penetration testing framework designed to perform social engineering attacks. Rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, SET focuses on human psychology, which is often the weakest link in security systems.

SET automates the process of creating realistic attack scenarios that help security professionals understand how users can be deceived and how such attacks can be prevented.


Common Use Cases in Security Labs

In controlled and ethical testing environments, SET is commonly used to:

Simulate phishing attacks

Create fake or cloned login pages

Send spoofed emails (for awareness testing)

Generate malicious payloads (for defensive analysis)

Test organizational security awareness and user behavior

These simulations help defenders identify weaknesses in human-centric security controls.


Project Focus: Website Cloning and Credential Harvesting

This particular lab focuses on website cloning using SEToolkit. The objective is to replicate a legitimate login page and host it locally in order to observe how attackers harvest credentials when a user unknowingly submits their login details to a fake website.

Through this lab, the following concepts are demonstrated:

How attackers clone legitimate websites

How fake login pages are used to capture credentials

How user input is harvested and logged by the attack framework

Why user awareness is critical in preventing phishing attacks


Ethical Disclaimer

This project was conducted strictly for educational purposes within a controlled lab environment.
No real users, organizations, or live systems were targeted.

Unauthorized use of SEToolkit or website cloning techniques against real targets is illegal and unethical.
